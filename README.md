# AutoOCR
Small OCR project, designed to help people with cheating their Sparx Homework, as it is a living hell. So I am here to try and solve that.
Written in Python, relatively new so report and bugs neccessary.

If you need help, either visit the help website: https://sites.google.com/d/19HukMLpB2eKp-GO7nwUdkE-59p0PzM14/p/1AhVCam5ZkOlCWkDOyNaM_xdPGjyN8upr/edit

Or you can contact me directly on discord: Spacey#5413

Have fun I guess
(don't snake)
